Given the additional information from the log file, here’s what you should do to recreate the Account.cpp file:

Understand the Constructor and Destructor:

The log file indicates that when accounts are created, they display a message with their index, amount, and the word "created."
You need to implement the constructor Account(int initial_deposit) to set the initial deposit, assign a unique index to each account, and print this message.
The destructor should display a message indicating the account index and the amount left, followed by "closed."
Implement Static Methods and Track Account Totals:

The log shows lines with accounts:, total:, deposits:, and withdrawals:, which indicates that the static methods getNbAccounts(), getTotalAmount(), getNbDeposits(), and getNbWithdrawals() need to keep track of these values globally across all accounts.
Implement displayAccountsInfos() to print the current totals of accounts, total amount, deposits, and withdrawals, as seen in the log file.
Create Methods for Deposits and Withdrawals:

The makeDeposit(int deposit) method should add the deposit amount to the account’s balance, increase the count of deposits, and update the static totals. It should also print a log line similar to index:0;p_amount:42;deposit:5;amount:47;nb_deposits:1 showing the previous amount, the deposit, the new amount, and the number of deposits.
The makeWithdrawal(int withdrawal) method should check if the withdrawal can be made (if there’s enough balance). If successful, it deducts the amount, updates the count of withdrawals, and prints a similar log line to the deposits. If the withdrawal cannot be made (e.g., insufficient funds), it should print a message with "withdrawal
."
Implement the Timestamp Feature:

The _displayTimestamp method should generate and print timestamps similar to [19920104_091532]. The date format is YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS, so you need to implement code to get the current system time and print it in this format.
Implement checkAmount and displayStatus:

The checkAmount method will likely return the current balance of the account.
The displayStatus method should print the account’s status, showing its index, balance, number of deposits, and withdrawals, matching the patterns from the log.
Make Sure Everything Matches the Log:

Your goal is to ensure that the output from tests.cpp matches the provided log file (except the timestamps which will be based on when you run the program).
Look closely at the patterns, such as how deposits and withdrawals are formatted, and implement those precisely.
By following these steps, you will be able to recreate the missing Account.cpp file and ensure the tests.cpp program runs correctly, producing output that matches the log.
